# Dice-Challenge

This project simulates a dice game where two random numbers are generated with each website refresh, representing two dice rolls. Three outcomes are possible: player 1 wins, player 2 wins, or a draw if the values are equal. The website then determines the winner based on the higher dice value between the two players. It's implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update and manipulate the elements on the web page, creating a seamless and interactive dice game experience for users.
